        <h3>Overview</h3>

        <p>
            IWC (Inter-Window Communication) provides an in-browser communications
            network between participants in multiple browser tabs, iframes, or
            workers using HTML5 standard features. These participants, which can
            be from different origins, can use the client API to send messages
            to any other participant on the network.
        </p>

        <p>
            For persistence, IWC connects to a backend service that exposes a
            REST API, in this case
            <a class="link-cursor" ng-click="endpointClicked(ozpIwc.config.apiRootUrl)">{{ozpIwc.config.apiRootUrl}}</a>.
            This REST API is HATEOAS (specifically HAL) compliant, so this debugger
            includes a HAL Browser to make exploring the API easier.
        </p>

        <p>
            IWC itself is broken down into a number of client-side APIs (all of
            which are backed by the the REST service mentioned above). The core
            APIs currently include:
        <ul>
            <li><code>system.api</code>: information about applications, users, and general system data like name and
                version
            </li>
            <li><code>data.api</code>: a key-value store for storing and retrieving application-specific data</li>
            <li><code>intents.api</code>: modeled off of Android, Intents are used to request actions from other
                applications
            </li>
            <li><code>names.api</code>: network details for the IWC bus</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <hr/>
        <h3>Network logging</h3>

        <p> The debugger has the following tools designed to debug IWC communication issues: </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Traffic Snooper</b>: Captures packets of data as they travel through the IWC. This tool does not
                persist packet captures,
                rather holds a copy as it is enabled.
            </li>
            <li><b>Metrics</b>: Captures metric values from the IWC on a periodic basis. If data is desired immediately,
                the <code>Gather</code> button will grab the latest values for the selected metrics.
            </li>
            <li><b>Elections</b>: A timeline of election events. Since the IWC is a distributed system, elections have
                to
                occur in order for a leader to be determined.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <hr/>

        <h3>APIs</h3>

        <p> Each api has a dedicated debugger page for viewing(<code>View Data</code>)and updating its resources(<code>Send
            Message</code>).
            Individual APIs have additional applications added for API specific debugging:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Data API:</b> <code>Webtop</code>: Parses and loads default Webtop dashboard data.</li>
            <li><b>System API:</b> <code>My Apps</code>: Lists bookmarked applications for the user's account.</li>
        </ul>
        <hr/>

        <h3>General Tools</h3>

        <p>Some tools are not IWC specific, but have great significance when trying to determine an IWC related error.
            These tools can be used for non IWC related tasks, but have been added to centralize tool locations.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>HAL Browser</b>: Used for exploring HAL data. The IWC backend is HAL compliant. This tool makes
                walking through data obtained from the backend faster and easier to understand by parsing HAL data into
                a
                more readable format.
            </li>
        </ul>
